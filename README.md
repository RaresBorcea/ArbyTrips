ANDROID FIRESTORE-BASED APP FOR TRIPS MANAGEMENT
At Sign-In, app queries Firestore for user’s trips and displays them in RecyclerView. On long clicking a trip in the list, a Context Menu with Edit and Delete options appears. Trips images can be selected from Gallery or taken from app’s own CameraActivity. Required permissions are granted through dialogs at run-time. Structured as a Navigation Drawer with Fragments.
