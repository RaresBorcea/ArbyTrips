# ArbyTrips

ANDROID FIRESTORE-BASED APP FOR TRIPS MANAGEMENT

Structured as a Navigation Drawer with Fragments. At Sign-In, app queries Cloud Firestore NoSQL database for user’s trips and displays them in a RecyclerView. When a trip is long clicked, a Context Menu with Edit and Delete options appears. Images can be added from Gallery or taken with app’s own CameraActivity, which writes JPGs through FileOutputStreams. Required permissions are granted at run-time.
